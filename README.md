#Problem-1 (String Problem):
  
  The user has a file that is made up of short (less than 1000 character) strings, each on a different line (assume any common character or character combination that means a newline to someone might be used interchangeably in this file). Most of these strings will be preceded by numbers, i.e. “2 Steaks”, “10 Chicken Wings”, “343GuiltySparks”. Accept the file from the user and return them a file with the same items sorted first by the numeric value of any leading number (2 < 10 < 343) and then alphabetically for the rest of the string.

#Problem-2 (Comments from API):
  The user wants a responsive web interface to see a particular comment from the mySidewalk engagement comments API. Load the comment with ID 100 (https://mysidewalk.com/api/engagement/v1/comments/100.json) from the API, redirect the window’s location to a path that represents a human friendly portion of the comment, and display the comment in a device response and visually pleasing manner.
